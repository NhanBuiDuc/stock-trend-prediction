It’s South by Southwest, an annual celebration that’s billed as both a conference and a festival, or somewhere in the middle, but as organizers and veterans will tell you, ‘you just have to be there.’ It’s a mashup of film, music, tech, and culture. A place where you can watch Ironman lecture a crowd on cyber-security, receive healthcare advice from the Jonas Brothers, and watch a movie premiere in virtual reality, all in one afternoon. But why is this happening? And who’s going? Well, everyone- fans, entrepreneurs, thrill seekers, investors, and they’re all going for the same reason- they’re looking for the next big thing. For the first time in a long time, the tech sector is experiencing a transformation. You’ve read about it in the news, heard about it in the break room, and you’ve seen it with your own eyes on social media. I’m talking about AI and what some are calling “deep tech” – those scientific advancements which include innovations in areas like virtual reality and robotics. Between star studded conversations and out-of-this-world exhibits, SXSW will give us a sneak peak into the future and how these new technologies will change our economy and our world, from the way we work, to the way we play. We’ll be speaking to the top thinkers and up and coming entrepreneurs about what all of this means for both businesses and consumers, because we’re on the edge of a brand new era in modern technology, and SXSW is the main stage. Over the past few years, there’s been a shift in how we think about the tech industry and the emergence of a new capital city for American business. Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL)— why are the world’s most valuable companies all moving to Austin, Texas? Could it be the weather? The taxes? The food?

Number one is national security: How will TikTok address privacy and data security concerns as well as how it handles user data, and what would TikTok do if the Chinese government says hand that data over?

Any wide-ranging U.S. ban could potentially hurt the more than 100,000 creators using TikTok for extra income.

But doing that will require more than just deleting the app from your phone. If you really want to give up TikTok, you’ll have to delete your account as well. Thankfully, it’s a relatively painless process, though the platform, like other social media companies, will certainly try to get you to stick around. To finally kick your TikTok habit, you’ll first want to go to your profile page by tapping the Profile button in the bottom right corner of the home screen. Select the options menu, by pressing the hamburger button in the top right of the screen, and tap Settings and Privacy in the pop-up window. Next press Account, then select Deactivate or Delete Account, and pick Delete account permanently. From there you can choose to download your old TikTok videos to save them offline, or you can just kiss them all goodbye by tapping the confirm button at the bottom of the screen.
