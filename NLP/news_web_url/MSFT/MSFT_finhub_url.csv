However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape.",https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=097189c1983ad2a98e61f9934ae7f0e7c1307851661ded41cbd06f931dac6bd9

To find out more, we went to the ground floor of the new tech sector, where technology meets culture, and the South meets the Southwest. Webster’s dictionary defines AI as “the simulation of human behavior in computers”. Sounds harmless right? But with the exploding popularity of generative chat bots like ChatGPT, many people are reexamining where they stand on the technological food chain. Ian Beacraft is one of the leading voices in deep tech and AI. His company, Signal and Cipher, teaches large companies how to adapt to new technology. “Generative ai is here. it's in everyone's palms and it's not going anywhere,” says Ian, telling Yahoo Finance that we’ve only scratched the surface of what AI can do. “We are at the very beginning of one of the biggest revolutions in knowledge work in human history and a lot of people look at this as a large step change in the way that we do our work… what we're doing is we are digitizing skills the same way that we mechanized physical labor in the industrial revolution… we're doing things at a scale, at a volume, and at a breadth that human minds aren't really capable of.” So, will the rise of AI lead to job losses? And if so, why should we embrace this technology? We met with Garry Kasparov, the former chess Grandmaster, famous for his series of chess matches against the 1980’s supercomputer, “Deep Blue”. “Every new technology in the past has threatened jobs, actually destroyed jobs, destroyed industry before creating new opportunities,” Kasparov told us. “AI is not the exception. Machines made us stronger in the past, made us faster in the past… so, many jobs we are doing today, in my view, are like zombie jobs. They're already dead. They just don't know yet.” So far, our experts have not painted a particularly rosy picture for the future of mankind, so we went directly to the source. You know what they say- keep your enemies close. According to ChatGPT, “Artificial intelligence has the potential to greatly impact the future of humanity in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, AI has the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, such as healthcare, education, and transportation.” That doesn’t sound too bad, but it goes on: “One major concern is that as AI systems become more advanced, they may become difficult to control, potentially leading to unintended consequences or even catastrophic outcomes.” Therein lies the concern, and why many in the tech industry are approaching AI with a good deal of caution. “People are getting freaked out. They’re saying ‘Hey, what is this thing? Can we trust it?’” “I see both sides of the argument. and, you know, in some ways, there is a lot of opportunity, but on the other hand, we also have to be careful, just like with any technology,” says Pulkit Agrawal, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at MIT. Instead of thinking of AI as a replacement for human beings, according to Pulkit, we should think of AI as a tool. Like the invention of the PC, artificial intelligence may actually improve our work and make humans more efficient in performing our day-to-day tasks. “If an AI system can look at CT scans, and make a diagnosis, is it going to replace a doctor or not? I would say no. I think the right way to implement the system is to make the system be an advisor to a doctor, because this AI system has looked at more CT scans than any doctor could have looked in his life,” Pulkit says. While the possibilities for AI may seem limitless, it could be the key to unlocking the potential of the human brain.

Concerns still abound however, and a well-known figure has entered the chat. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai told '60 Minutes' artificial intelligence could be very ""harmful"" if used incorrectly, and called for further regulatory frameworks. That's a sentiment echoed by Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY; he told Yahoo Finance Live that regulation is ""a necessary framework."" The conversation was timely, with EU lawmakers reportedly drawing up plans to regulate the space with a new set of tailored rules. The U.S. Commerce Department has also set out its stall; it's currently fielding opinions on the need for A.I. audits and risk assessments. Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""
