This report is intended to foster transparency about what various funds are doing, but it has the added benefit of allowing investors to see what top-level investors like Warren Buffett or George Soros, are doing with the capital they manage.  As for George Soros, his Soros Fund Management private firm manages a little over $5 billion in assets, and the fund's largest holding is in electric vehicle maker Rivian (although he decreased his stake in the company by 10% this quarter)."

It is the average price for the day, weighted by volume, with each share traded getting equal weight. The cumulative average builds throughout the day, and if more volume comes in on an up move, the VWAP will rise, but if more volume comes in as the market moves lower, the VWAP will decline, and prices will be below it. According to veteran trader and alphatrends.net founder Brian Shannon, CMT, we can determine with 100% accuracy who has control at the beginning of the day based on where the VWAP is in relation to it. When thinking about support and resistance levels, traders use the word ""porosity,"" which is similar to drawing a trendline with a crayon instead of a straight edge, where the VWAP becomes a battleground in that area. He calls them levels of interest rather than levels of resistance. The anchored VWAP initiated from the all-time high for the NASDAQ, for instance. It measures sentiments with precision and tells us that from that top, the average long participant is losing money because the price is lower than the average, while the average short seller is making money. Shannon advises that as the market comes up to the anchored VWAP, not only will long people be looking to break even, but short sellers might put a big offer on there and try to scare the long holders out of it. He sees it as a transition of a balance of power, and if buyers are able to wrestle away control and take control of the trend, prices can re-emerge in a new uptrend supported by the average participant being in a profitable position and the average short seller scrambling to cover their losses. Shannon advises looking at the shorter-term timeframe for trend alignment and measuring sentiment and psychology to determine who is in control from a particular event. He suggests measuring VWAP from an event and looking for the first couple of days or two, where buyers gain control, and then a battle ensues where sellers regain control. By analyzing the sentiment and psychology, traders can determine whether the buyers or sellers have regained control and make informed trading decisions."

Benioff said he welcomed the new board members and said they’ll be great for the company and its shareholders. “We have three great new board members, and that's five new board members in the last 16 months. Incredible” Benioff said. The three new boardroom hires at Salesforce are Sachin Mehra, Mastercard’s Chief Financial Officer; Mason Morfit, ValueAct Capital’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer; and Arnold Donald, the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation. Benioff had particular praise for Donald: “probably one of my favorite CEOs of all time, one of the top CEOs in the world” he told Yahoo Finance. Benioff however, did not mention the more aggressive activists targeting Salesforce, specifically Elliott Management or Starboard Value. Benioff spoke to Yahoo Finance after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter. Some analysts mused that the blowout results could also help Benioff outflank the activists currently circling his company."

However, there are certain aspects of AI that major players such as Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI may not want the general public to be aware of. According to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Real Vision Group, the current AI boom is comparable to the biggest bubbles in history. Pal believes that the explosive growth of AI applications is going to create a huge bubble that will be impossible to ignore. He suggests that investing in semiconductor companies such as Nvidia is the best way for individuals to take advantage of this trend, as these companies provide the necessary processing power for AI systems. Microsoft and Google are currently the easiest ways for investors to gain exposure to AI. These companies have massive networks that will undoubtedly benefit from the growth of AI applications. Furthermore, both companies are pivoting their business models to incorporate AI, which will likely result in further growth and profitability. Pal also highlights the fact that AI is still in its early stages, and there are likely to be many more opportunities for investors to profit from this technology in the future. He notes that other major players such as Apple and Amazon are also developing their own AI technologies, and the Chinese have their own AI systems. However, Pal points out that the most significant game-changer in the AI industry is Stability AI. This open-source AI platform is available to everyone and is not restricted by any corporate interests or regulations. Pal suggests that this technology could be difficult to control and could lead to unforeseen consequences as it develops. Finally, Pal warns of the potential dangers of AI-generated fake content. With the development of chat, text-to-audio, and text-to-video AI technologies, the creation of fake content at an unprecedented scale is now possible. This poses a significant risk to society, and regulators will need to address this issue as AI technology continues to advance. In conclusion, while the growth of AI applications presents many opportunities for investors and businesses alike, there are also risks and challenges that need to be addressed. It is important for investors to stay informed and cautious as they navigate the rapidly changing AI landscape."

""This app preys on children,"" Keith Krach, chairman of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue, tells Yahoo! Finance. Krach, who served as former under secretary of state in the Trump administration, says the app monitors private information like bank records and location data. The app, which is ultimately owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has also seen criticism for allegations of censorship, access of U.S. user data, and propaganda concerns. TikTok's ownership has made it a long-running target by the U.S. government, with the Trump Administration saying in 2020 it would ban the app. TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress today in the hopes of addressing some of these concerns. The executive said TikTok pledged commitments in four key areas: it would keep teenager safety a top priority, prevent unauthorized foreign access of U.S. user data, commit to free expression, and will be transparent and give access to monitors. Critics say the commitments do not go far enough. ""This app is built to be weaponized,"" says Keith Krach, chairman of the Krach Institute for Tech Diplomacy at Purdue.

Concerns still abound however, and a well-known figure has entered the chat. Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai told '60 Minutes' artificial intelligence could be very ""harmful"" if used incorrectly, and called for further regulatory frameworks. That's a sentiment echoed by Douglas Rushkoff, Professor of Media Theory and Digital Economics at CUNY; he told Yahoo Finance Live that regulation is ""a necessary framework."" The conversation was timely, with EU lawmakers reportedly drawing up plans to regulate the space with a new set of tailored rules. The U.S. Commerce Department has also set out its stall; it's currently fielding opinions on the need for A.I. audits and risk assessments. Rushkoff says that when it comes to regulating artificial intelligence, the easiest way ""isn't to change what A.I.s do, it's to change what we do."" ""Raising A.I. is a bit like raising children,"" he adds, ""they're going to listen to whatever is going on in the room.""

With a net worth of more than $100 billion, recent stock purchases over the last 15 years have helped Buffett’s wealth massively increase. So what exactly is his investment philosophy?

In other words, rather than buying stocks, he buys businesses that have a competitive advantage. This approach has made him one of the most successful investors in history, and anyone can invest like him by following his strategies. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer zeroes in on the big companies Warren Buffett invests in, including Costco (COST) and Coca-Cola (KO), and breaks down why his investment strategy works, but also, can sometimes cause him to miss out on some big winners."
